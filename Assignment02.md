## Java Imports & Packages
**Package is a collection of related classes. Java uses package to group related classes, interfaces and sub-packages in any Java project.**

### Types Of Java Package
- Built-in Package: math, util, lang, i/o etc are the example of built-in packages.
- User-defined-package: Java package created by user to categorize their project's classes and interface are known as user-defined packages.

### How to import Java Package
- To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program.
- Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name.


## Different types of loops in Java
**looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.**

### For Loop
- When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop

### While loop
- The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true

### Do-While Loop
- The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
