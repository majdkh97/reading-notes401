## Java OO Tutorial
**Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.**

**A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.**

**In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:**
- subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

**An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:**

**A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:**
- Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
- User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

## Numbers
- Decimals : In Java, we have two primitive types that represent decimal numbers â€“ float and decimal:
- Bases : (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)
- Binary Numbers :is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system
- Hexadecimal Numbers : s a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16)
