## Java OO Tutorial
**Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.**

**A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.**

## Inheritance
- is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
- The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
- When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. 
- Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

## Interface
- An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
- The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
- There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
- it is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
- In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.
