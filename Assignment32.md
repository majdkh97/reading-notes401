## Intro to Serverless

### So, What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

**Serverless applications are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).**

### Functions as a Service (FaaS)

FaaS is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic. They start within milliseconds (~100ms for AWS Lambda) and process individual requests within a 300-second timeout imposed by most cloud vendors.

### Principles of FaaS

- Complete management of servers
- Invocation based billing
- Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

### Key properties of FaaS

- Independent, server-side, logical functions

- Stateless

- Ephemeral

- Event-triggered

- Scalable by default

- Fully managed by a Cloud vendor
